%% OK, by now we have detected whether ctex can be used. If so,

%% some other means to deal with them.

%% Either way, we will define two commands:
%% \zh{xxxx} is used to render Chinese text
%% \zhb{xxxx} renders Chinese text in a box, preventing strange

%% In the case of ctex, we do not actually need those comments,
